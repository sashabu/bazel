# Documentation Versions

{% dynamic setvar source_file "site/en/versions/index.md" %}
{% include "_buttons.html" %}

The default documentation on this website represents the latest version at HEAD.
Each major and minor supported release will have a snapshot of the narrative and
reference documentation that follows the lifecycle of Bazel's version support.

To see documentation for stable Bazel versions, use the "Versioned docs"
drop-down.

To see documentation for older Bazel versions prior to Feb 2022, go to
[docs.bazel.build](https://docs.bazel.build/).
